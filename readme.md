# Introduction to Structs - Object-Oriented Programming in GameMaker Studio 2.3

One of the more fun additions to the 2.3 GML update, the ability to create lightweight blobs of data, or "structs." You can now organize data into objects without all of the overhead that comes with using regular instances! There are quite a few things you can do with these, and I'll be making more videos about constructors and inheritance and methods and all of those wonderful object-oriented things in the future.

These are sometimes also unofficially called "lightweight objects," so if you ever hear me (or other people) mention those, just know that we're referring to structs.
